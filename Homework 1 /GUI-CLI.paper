CLI stands for Command Line Interface. CLIs receive input through a command prompt through text strings so all of the information is shown to the user in plain text and files. 
The only operating system required for CLI is a keyboard and the appearance of a CLI screen can't be changed since there are no menus or graphics. Since CLI doen't rely on graphics, it 
requires users to know specific commands and syntax. CLI also requires less memory and has higher precision/speed compared to GUI. 
GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. As the name states, GUI uses graphic elements like icons, buttons, and menus for users to interact with the system. This is a more user friendly 
approach as there is a visual reference for the functions. GUIs also require a keyboard but need a pointing device, like a mouse too. There is less control and limited functionalites with GUI
copared to CLI.
